# CDRC-Retail-Indicators - Development of Indicators for 2021 CDRC Retail Centres Release. 

## Data

2021 Retail Centres are avialable to download for free from the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) at: https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/retail-centre-boundaries.

We also utilise a series of other datasets to assist in development of indicators for the centres:

- Local Data Company (LDC) Retail Type & Vacancy dataset [SECURE], from 2018-2020, available at:
- Internet User Classification (IUC) from 2018, available at:
- Population Estimates for England/Wales (LSOA) & Scotland (DataZone), available at: 

## Indicators

Indicators are developed for a subset of the 6,423 Retail Centres. The indicators are:

- Composition of Centres - proportions of different types of retail (e.g. Comparison, Service).
- Vacancy of Centres - proportions of vacant units, 1 & 2-year vacancy rates.
- Diversity of Centres - proportions of independents and national chains, proportions of retailers characteristically found in 'clone' towns.
- Online Vulnerability - online shopping propensity in catchment of centres.
- E-Resilience of Centres.
- Catchments - drive-time catchments, varying in size by centre classification (e.g. Regional Centre 20mins, Local Centre 10 mins).
